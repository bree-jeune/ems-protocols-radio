FOREWORD
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PROTOCOL MANUAL

Optimal prehospital care results from a combination of careful patient assessment, essential prehospital emergency medical services, and appropriate medical consultation. The purpose of this manual is to provide guidance for ALL prehospital care providers and emergency department physicians within the Clark County EMS System.

The GOAL of the manual is to STANDARDIZE prehospital patient care in Clark County. It is to be understood that these protocols are guidelines. Nothing contained in these protocols shall be construed to expand the scope of practice of any licensed Attendant beyond that which is identified in the Clark County Emergency Medical Services Regulations and these protocols (Appendix C).

NOTHING contained within these protocols is meant to delay rapid patient transport to a receiving facility. Patient care should be rendered while en-route to a definitive treatment facility.

The General Assessment protocols must be followed in the specific sequence noted. For all other
treatment protocols, the algorithm defines the care every patient should receive, usually in the order described.

To maintain the life of a specific patient, it may be necessary, in rare instances, for the physician providing on-line medical consultation, as part of the EMS consultation system, to direct a prehospital provider in rendering care that is not explicitly listed within these protocols, to include administering a patient's own medications which are not part of the approved formulary. To proceed with such an order, both the telemetry physician and the provider must acknowledge and agree that the patient's condition and extraordinary care are not addressed elsewhere within these medical protocols, and
that the order is in the best interest of patient care. Additionally, the provider must feel capable, based on the instructions given by the telemetry physician, of correctly performing the directed care.
Whenever such care is provided, the telemetry physician and the provider must immediately notify the
Office of EMS & Trauma System (OEMSTS) of the extraordinary care situation. In addition, the provider must immediately, upon completion of the call, make available the prehospital care record and documentation specifying the nature of the deviation and the ordering physician's name to the OEMSTS. All such incidents will be entered into the Quality Improvement Review process.

Occasionally a situation may arise in which a physician's order cannot be carried out, e.g., the provider feels the administration of an ordered medication would endanger the patient, a medication is not available, or a physician's order is outside of protocol. If this occurs, the provider must immediately notify the telemetry physician as to the reason the order cannot be carried out, and indicate on the prehospital care record what was ordered, the time, and the reason the order could
not be carried out. In addition, the provider must immediately notify the OEMSTS, and upon completion of the call, make available the prehospital care record to the OEMSTS. All such incidents will be
entered into the Quality Improvement Review process.

Specific Protocol

E	EMT Licensed Attendant and above may perform these steps A	AEMT Licensed Attendant and above may perform these steps P	Paramedic Licensed Attendant
Definition of a patient:
A patient is any individual that meets at least one of the following criteria:
1) A person who has a complaint or mechanism suggestive of potential illness or injury;
2) A person who has obvious evidence of illness or injury; or
3) A person identified by an informed 2nd or 3rd party caller as requiring evaluation for potential illness or injury.

Pediatric patient considerations:
For patients <18 years old, use the Pediatric Patient Destination protocol.
Pediatric treatment protocols are to be used on children who have not yet experienced puberty. Signs of puberty include chest or underarm hair on males, and any breast development in females.

These protocols have been developed specifically for the Clark County EMS System and represent consensus among all of the Clark County EMS agency medical directors and the District
Health Officer. The protocols demonstrate a commitment to a consistent approach to quality patient care.

From time to time, protocols may be added or revised by the District Health Officer upon recommendation by the Medical Advisory Board (MAB). Additional recommendations are welcome and appreciated
at any time. They may be submitted to the OEMSTS for consideration and referral to the Medical Advisory Board.

Pearls

Signs and Symptoms
* Anxiety, agitation, confusion
* Affect change, hallucinations
* Delusional thoughts, bizarre behavior
* Combative, violent

Differential
* AMS differential
* Alcohol intoxication
* Toxin/substance abuse
* Medication effect or overdose
* Withdrawal syndromes
* Depression
* Bipolar
* Schizophrenia
* Anxiety disorder

* Pharmacological sedation is a medical procedure that results from a medical assessment. Sedation is never to be utilized to control behavior for the purpose of law enforcement initiatives or assistance.
* Law enforcement assistance should be requested on all calls involving potentially violent patients.
* Under no circumstances are patients to be transported restrained in the prone position.
* Patients may not be transported with their arms restrained behind their back or in an ankle-to-wrist (hog-tied) manner.
* The clinician should be ready to resuscitate the patient in case of inadvertent changes in respiratory or hemodynamic status. Patients should be continuously monitored with all available adjuncts when possible, including HR, ECG, RR, SpO2, BP, ETCO2, perfusion state, mental state.
* Physical restraints, including gurney straps, should never restrict chest wall movement.
* Patients expressing suicidal or homicidal ideation or who are otherwise a danger to themselves or others may not refuse transport. Contact law enforcement if necessary to initiate legal hold.
* EMS providers are not to remove taser darts unless there is a need to do so to administer medical care. Dart removal is part of the education to use the device and is the responsibility of the person or agency who deploys the device.
Dystonic Reaction
* Condition causing involuntary muscle movements or spasms typically of the face, neck and upper extremities.
* Typically an adverse reaction to drugs such as Haloperidol (may occur with administration).
* When recognized, administer Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM/IV/IO.
S.A.F.E.R.
* Stabilize the situation by containing and lowering the stimuli.
* Assess and acknowledge the crisis.
* Facilitate the identification and activation of resources (chaplain, family, friends or police).
* Encourage patient to use resources and take actions in his/her best interest.
* Recovery or referral - leave patient in care of responsible person or professional, or transport to appropriate facility.

* Inhalational injury
* Time of injury
* Past medical history & medications
* Other trauma

* Tetanus/immunization status

Pearls

Signs and Symptoms
* Burns, pain, swelling
* Dizziness
* Loss of consciousness
* Hypotension/shock
* Airway compromise/distress
* Wheezing
* Singed facial or nasal hair
* Hoarseness or voice changes

Differential
* Superficial (1st degree) - red and painful
* Partial Thickness (2nd degree) - blistering
* Full Thickness (3rd degree) - painless/charred or leathery skin
* Thermal
* Chemical
* Electrical
* Radiation
* Lightning

* Burn patients are trauma patients; evaluate for multisystem trauma.
* Assure whatever has caused the burn, is no longer contacting the injury. (Stop the burning process!)
* Recommended Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Neck, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremities, Back, Neuro.
* Consider early intubation with patients experiencing significant inhalation injuries.
* Potential CO exposure should be treated with 100% oxygen. (For patients in which the primary event is CO inhalation, transport to a hospital equipped with a hyperbaric chamber is indicated [when reasonably accessible].)
* Circumferential burns to extremities are dangerous due to potential vascular compromise secondary to soft tissue swelling. Elevate extremity.
* Burn patients are prone to hypothermia - never apply ice or cool
burns; must maintain normal body temperature.
* Consider ETCO2 monitoring.
Early Intubation Indications
* Signs of Airway Obstruction	• Burns in Mouth
* Hoarseness, Stridor, Dysphagia	• Total BSA = 40%
* Extensive Deep Facial Burns	• Altered Mentation
* Signs of Respiratory Compromise	• Significant Risk of Edema
-Accessory Muscle Use
-Inability to Clear Secretions
-Poor Oxygenation

Patients meeting the following criteria shall be transported to the closest appropriate Burn Care Center:
1. Second degree burns >10% body surface area (BSA).
2. Any Third degree burns.
3. Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints.
4. Electrical burns including lightning injury.
5. Chemical burns.
6. Circumferential burns.
7. Inhalation burns.
8. Burn injury with concomitant trauma



Pearls (Electrical)
* Do not contact the patient until you are certain the source of the electric shock has been disconnected.
* Attempt to locate contact points, (entry wound where the AC source contacted the patient; an exit at the ground point); both sites will generally be full thickness.
* Cardiac monitor; anticipate ventricular or atrial irregularity to include V-Tach, V-Fib, heart blocks, etc.
* Attempt to identify the nature of the electrical source (AC vs DC), the amount of voltage and the amperage the patient may have been exposed to during the electrical shock.

Pearls (Chemical)
* Certainly 0.9% NaCl Sol'n or Sterile Water is preferred; however if it is not readily available, do not delay; use tap water for flushing the affected area or other immediate water sources. Flush the area as soon as possible with the cleanest, readily available water or saline solution using copious amounts of fluids.

Pearls

* Efforts should be directed at high quality and continuous compressions with limited interruptions and early defibrillation when indicated. Crews should consider using a "pit crew" approach with predefined roles and crew resource management principles.
* Consider early IO placement if IV is difficult.
* Ventilation rate should be 8-10 breaths per minute. Hyperventilation can worsen patient outcomes.
* Continuous waveform capnography should be monitored throughout resuscitation for confirmation and monitoring of advanced airways (when present), as well as monitoring effectiveness of chest compressions.
* Mechanical chest compression devices may be utilized if available. If utilized, the mechanical CPR device should be applied in a manner that minimizes interruptions in compressions, keeping breaks in CPR to less than 10 seconds. Use mechanical CPR devices per manufacturer's guidelines. Manual CPR must be initiated before the application of a CPR device. Ideally, complete 2 rounds of manual compressions before application.
* If a patient is pregnant at or over 20 weeks estimated gestational age OR if the fundus is palpable above the umbilicus, apply the following interventions: During CPR, an additional rescuer should apply continuous manual leftward lateral displacement of the uterus to reduce pressure on the inferior vena cava and improve venous return. Vascular access should be obtained above the diaphragm. If no ROSC after two rounds of BLS/ACLS, consider immediate transport to the nearest Emergency Department for possible Resuscitative Cesarean Delivery (RCD).

Pearls
* Recommended exam: Mental Status, Skin, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Back, Extremities, Neuro.
* Hypotension can be defined as a systolic BP of <90. This is not always reliable and should be interpreted in context and patient's typical BP, if known. Shock may present with a normal BP initially.
* Hypovolemia or distributive shock should be addressed with a fluid bolus prior to the administration of push-dose pressors.
* While there are no absolute contraindications to epinephrine, it should be used with caution in elderly patients, patients with known cardiovascular disease, or significant tachycardia or hypertension, and should be administered only when the patient's signs and symptoms are severe.
* Shock often is present with normal vital signs and may develop insidiously. Tachycardia
may be the only manifestation.
* Consider all possible causes of shock and treat per appropriate protocol.
* An ETCO2 measurement of <25 mm Hg is indicative of shock

Hypovolemic shock
* Hemorrhage, trauma, GI bleeding, ruptured aortic aneurysm, or pregnancy related bleeding
Cardiogenic shock
* Heart failure, MI, cardiomyopathy, myocardial contusion, toxins

Continue Care and Transport as Appropriate




Always weigh the risks and benefits of endotracheal intubation in the field against transport. All prehospital endotracheal intubations are considered high risk. If ventilation/oxygenation is adequate, transport may be the best option. The most important airway device and the most difficult to use correctly and effectively is the Bag Valve Mask (not the laryngoscope). Few prehospital airway emergencies cannot be temporized or managed with proper BVM techniques.

DIFFICULT AIRWAY ASSESSMENT:

Difficult BVM Ventilation-MOANS: Difficult Mask seal due to facial hair, anatomy, blood or secretions/trauma; Obese or late pregnancy; Age >55; No teeth (roll gauze and place between gums and cheeks to improve seal); Stiff or increased airway pressures (asthma, COPD, obese, pregnant).

Difficult Laryngoscopy-LEMON: Look externally for anatomical distortions (small mandible, short neck, large tongue); Evaluate 3-3-2 Rule (Mouth open should accommodate 3 patient fingers, mandible to neck junction should accommodate 3 patient fingers, chin-neck junction to thyroid prominence should accommodate 2 patient fingers); Mallampati (difficult to assess in the field); Obstruction / Obese or late pregnancy; Neck mobility.

Difficult Extraglottic Device Placement-RODS: Restricted mouth opening; Obstruction / Obese or late pregnancy;
Distorted or disrupted airway; Stiff or increased airway pressures (asthma, COPD, obese, pregnant).

Nasotracheal intubation: Orotracheal intubation is the preferred choice. Procedure requires patient to have spontaneous breathing. Contraindicated in anatomically disrupted or distorted airways, increased intracranial pressure, severe facial trauma, basal skull fracture, head injury.


Pearls
* Consider preoxygenation/lung denitrogenation with a non-rebreather, a nasal cannula at 15 LPM, or NIPPV prior to intubation (as patient condition allows).
* Severe hypotension (SBP<90) should be addressed with IV fluids and/or pressors (as appropriate) prior to intubation in order to reduce the likelihood of post-intubation cardiovascular decline.
* Capnometry (Color) or capnography is mandatory with all methods of intubation. Document results.
* Continuous capnography (ETCO2) is mandatory for the monitoring of all patients with an ET tube.
* If an effective airway is being maintained by BVM and/or basic airway adjuncts (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway) with continuous pulse oximetry values of =90% or values expected based on pathophysiologic condition
with otherwise reassuring vital signs (e.g. pulse oximetry of 85% with otherwise normal vitals in a post-drowning patient), it is acceptable to continue with basic airway measures instead of using an extraglottic airway device or intubation. Consider NIPPV as indicated by protocol and patient condition.
* For the purposes of this protocol, a secure airway is achieved when the patient is receiving appropriate oxygenation and ventilation.
* An intubation attempt is defined as passing the laryngoscope blade or endotracheal tube past the teeth or inserted into the nasal passage.
* An appropriate ventilatory rate is one that maintains an ETCO2 of 35 - 45. Avoid hyperventilation.
* Paramedics should use an extraglottic airway device if oral-tracheal intubation is unsuccessful.
* Maintain C-spine stabilization for patients with suspected spinal injury.
* Gastric tube placement should be considered in all intubated patients, if time allows.
* It is important to secure the endotracheal tube well.

Pearls (Electrical)
* Do not contact the patient until you are certain the source of the electric shock has been disconnected.
* Attempt to locate contact points, (entry wound where the AC source contacted the patient; an exit at the ground point); both sites will generally be full thickness.
* Cardiac monitor; anticipate ventricular or atrial irregularity to include V-Tach, V-Fib, heart blocks, etc.
* Attempt to identify the nature of the electrical source (AC vs DC), the amount of voltage and the amperage the patient may have been exposed to during the electrical shock.


Pearls (Chemical)
* Certainly 0.9% NaCl Sol'n or Sterile Water is preferred; however if it is not readily available, do not delay; use tap water for flushing the affected area or other immediate water sources. Flush the area as soon as possible with the cleanest, readily available water or saline solution using copious amounts of fluids.

Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Non-Traumatic(updated and approved by MAB 04/3/2024)

  


Pearls
* Respiratory failure resulting in cardiac arrest should be addressed as it is identified.
* Efforts should be directed at high quality chest compressions with limited interruptions and early defibrillation when indicated.
* Consider early IO placement if IV is difficult.
* DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE.
* Once an advanced airway is in place, compressions should be continuous with ventilations every three seconds.
* Reassess and document ETT placement using auscultation and ETCO2 capnography.
* Switch compressors every two minutes.
* Try to maintain patient modesty.
* Mechanical chest compression devices should be used if available and appropriate for patient age/size in order to provide for consistent uninterrupted chest compressions and crew safety.
* Adult paddles/pads may be used on children weighing greater than 10 kg.
* Pre-assignment of pit crew roles is recommended. When this is not possible, tasks may be assigned by order of arrival: 1st: Airway; 2nd: Compressions; 3rd: IV/IO access, medication administration; 4th: Measure, Monitor/AED placement; 5th: family liaison/history gathering
* Pre-plan drug dosing based on weight estimations while en route and verify with a height based tape once reaching the patient
* Proper BVM selection: <5 kg = infant BVM. 5-30 kg = pediatric BVM. >30 kg = adult BVM.
H's & T's (reversible causes)
* Hypovolemia - Volume infusion
* Hypoxia - Oxygenation & ventilation, CPR
* Hydrogen ion (acidosis) - Ventilation, CPR
* Hyperkalemia - Calcium Chloride, Glucose, Sodium Bicarbonate, Albuterol
* Hypokalemia
* Hypothermia - Warming
* Hypoglycemia - Glucose
* Tension pneumothorax - Needle decompression
* Tamponade, cardiac - Volume infusion
* Toxins - Agent specific antidote
* Thrombosis, pulmonary - Volume infusion
* Thrombosis, coronary - Emergent PCI

Pearls
* Consider preoxygenation/lung denitrogenation with a non-rebreather or a nasal cannula at 15 LPM prior to intubation (as patient condition allows)
* Severe hypotension (SBP 70+(2 X age)) should be addressed with IV fluids and/or pressors (as appropriate) prior to intubation in order to reduce likelihood of post-intubation cardiovascular decline.
* Capnometry (Color) or capnography is mandatory with all methods of intubation. Document results.
* Continuous capnography (ETCO2) is mandatory for the monitoring of all patients with an ET tube.
* If an effective airway is being maintained by BVM and/or basic airway adjuncts (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway) with continuous pulse oximetry values of =90%, or values expected based on pathophysiologic condition
with otherwise reassuring vital signs (e.g. pulse oximetry of 85% with otherwise normal vitals in a post drowning patient), it is acceptable to continue with basic airway measures instead of using an extraglottic airway device or intubation.
* For the purposes of this protocol, a secure airway is achieved when the patient is receiving appropriate oxygenation and ventilation.
* An Intubation Attempt is defined as passing the laryngoscope blade or endotracheal tube past the teeth or
inserted into the nasal passage.
* An appropriate ventilatory rate is one that maintains an ETCO2 of 35 - 45. Avoid hyperventilation.
* Paramedics should use an extraglottic airway device if oral-tracheal intubation is unsuccessful.
* Maintain C-spine stabilization for patients with suspected spinal injury.
* Gastric tube placement should be considered in all intubated patients if time allows.
* It is important to secure the endotracheal tube well.

Public Intoxication/Mental Health Crisis (revised and approved by MAB 09/03/2025)



When EMS or hospital personnel wish to have an incident involving patient care reviewed within the Clark County EMS system, the following steps shall be taken:
1. The person requesting a review of an incident should contact the designated representative of the agency/ hospital involved to initiate the process. If after gathering appropriate information and discussing the incident both parties are satisfied a problem does not exist, nothing further needs to be done.
2. If either party would like to pursue an investigation of the incident, the "Southern Nevada Health District EMS Incident Report" should be completed and a copy should be forwarded to the OEMSTS.
3. Upon receipt of the "Southern Nevada Health District EMS Incident Report" OEMSTS staff will review the
case, gather information from the agencies/hospitals involved, and evaluate the need for further investigation. The agency/hospital may be asked to conduct an internal investigation, involving their medical director when appropriate, and provide a summary of their findings to the OEMSTS.
4. The personnel involved in the incident may be interviewed by the EMS medical director or his designee and their agency/hospital medical director to gather additional information.
5. Upon completion of the investigation, a report will be prepared and given to the agency/hospital representatives involved. Direct communication between the agency/hospital and complainant is recommended with a brief written summary of actions taken provided to the OEMSTS.
6. A quarterly aggregate summary of the incidents reviewed by the OEMSTS will be prepared and reported at the Quality Improvement Directors and Medical Advisory Board meetings.
7. All documentation and correspondence regarding this quality improvement activity; to monitor, review, evaluate, and report on the necessity, quality, and level of care provided a patient is confidential pursuant to NRS 49.117 - NRS 49.123, NRS 49.265, NRS 450B.810 and NRS 629.061.



























Quality Improvement Review



1. Licensed EMS personnel are not obligated to continue resuscitation efforts that have been started by
other persons at the scene if the patient meets the criteria listed in the Prehospital Death Determination protocol. This includes telephone CPR initiated by Emergency Medical Dispatchers.
2. Resuscitation should be terminated/ not initiated without telemetry contact if a valid DNR/POLST or physician written order is provided.

3. Resuscitation started in the field may be discontinued only by a telemetry physician order when the following conditions have been met:
A. For medical arrest, contact closest hospital for telemetry physician order:
The patient remains in persistent asystole or agonal rhythm after twenty (20) minutes of appropriate resuscitation, to include:
1) CPR
2) Effective ventilation with 100% oxygenation
3) Administration of appropriate ACLS medications, if available.
4) Confirm no organized rhythm or PEA<40, or a "No Shock Advised" on AED
B. For traumatic arrest, contact TRAUMA CENTER based on catchment for telemetry physician order:
1) Open airway with basic life support measures
2) Provide CPR and effective ventilations with 100% oxygenation for two (2) minutes
3) Perform bilateral needle decompression if tension pneumothorax suspected
4) Confirm no organized rhythm or PEA <40, or a "No Shock Advised" on AED

C. The patient develops, or is found to have one of the following conclusive signs of death at
any point during the resuscitative effort:
1) Lividity
2) Rigor mortis
4. When resuscitation has been terminated in the field, all medical interventions shall be left in place.
5. If possible, do not leave a body unattended. Once a responsible person (i.e. Coroner's investigator, police, security, or family member) is present at the scene, you may be excused.
6. NEVER transport/move a body without permission from the Coroner's office, except for assessment or its protection.

If the body is in the public view and cannot be isolated, screened, or blocked from view, and is creating an unsafe situation with citizens/family, the body can be covered with a clean, STERILE BURN SHEET obtained from the EMS vehicle.

NOTES: In rural or wilderness situations, EMS providers must make every effort to contact medical control, but resuscitation may be terminated in the field without medical control when any of the following have occurred:
A. There has been no return of pulse despite greater than 20 minutes of CPR and effective ventilation (consider extending in the case of hypothermia or drowning)
B. Transport to an emergency department will take greater than 40 minutes (consider extending in the case
of hypothermia or drowning)
C. The EMS providers are exhausted and it is physically impossible to continue the resuscitation.

Yellow EMS Judgment
***Patients of any age meeting these criteria may be transported to the same trauma catchment area as Yellow Mechanism of Injury but may be taken to another appropriate receiving facility based on EMS provider judgment.


Additional Notes:
* All trauma calls that meet the Trauma Field Triage Criteria protocol, regardless of location, that are transported by air ambulance are to be transported to University Medical Center/Trauma and the medical directions for the treatment of the patient must originate at that center.
* Nothing contained within these guidelines precludes transport to any trauma facility if, in the provider's judgment, time to transport to the designated center would be unduly prolonged due to traffic and/or weather conditions and might jeopardize the patient's condition.
* Nothing contained within these guidelines precludes transport to the closest facility if, in the provider's judgment, an ability to adequately ventilate the patient might result in increased patient mortality.
* Trauma center internal disaster and trauma bypass status must be considered.
* Trauma patients (or their parent or guardian) who refuse transport to the closest appropriate trauma center must sign a release of medical assistance acknowledging their refusal.

Key procedural considerations:
A. If (A-E) above are ALL NEGATIVE, cervical stabilization is not required.
B. If required, cervical stabilization is the placement of an approved, properly- sized cervical collar before the patient is moved.
C. Tape, head straps, wedges, and head and/or neck support devices are not
recommended.
D. 	Patients found in motor vehicles should be asked if they are able to exit the motor vehicle on their own. If so, they should be assisted to a soft stretcher and secured for transport. Patients unable to exit the vehicle on
their own accord should be removed by the appropriate extrication method.
E. Once on the stretcher, the patient may be moved to a semi-Fowler's or high-Fowler's position for comfort.
F. If a backboard is used for extrication or movement, the patient should be immediately moved to a soft mattress, if possible.
G. In special situations, alternate stabilization devices (e.g. vacuum mattress, KED, etc. may be used as indicated).
H. Pediatric patients may be stabilized in an approved car seat or with a
commercial pediatric stabilization device.

Key Procedural Considerations:
* Treat the patient with respect. Attempts to verbally reassure or calm the patient should be done prior to the use of restraints. To the extent possible, explain what is being done and why.
* Acceptable restraints are "hard-type" restraints made of padded leather material or "soft-type" restraints made of padded soft cloth or Velcro and which are manufactured for the purpose of restraint. Gauze (e.g. kerlix), tape, or hard plastic ties should not be used.
* Any restraint device used must allow for rapid removal if necessary for management of the patient's medical condition, including airway, breathing, or circulation.
* Restraints should be secured to the frame of the gurney. Avoid securing restraints to moveable parts such as rails, levers, etc.
* Apply restraints to the extent necessary to allow treatment of, and prevent injury to, the patient. Under- restraint may place both patient and clinician at greater risk. Restraints may be applied to all four extremities, or both upper extremities, or to one upper and one lower extremity.
* Patients shall be restrained in the supine position.
* The patient's upper extremities should be restrained at the wrist, either at the patient's sides or with one arm above the patient's head and the other to the side.
* The patient's lower extremities should be restrained at the ankles in the extended and uncrossed position.
* If necessary, straps may be placed across the patient's pelvis and/or legs.
* Gurney seatbelts/straps may be used as designed, but must not restrict breathing/chest movement. Additional straps may not be placed on the patient's neck, chest, or abdomen, and patient should not be sandwiched by any device.
* After application of restraints, check all restrained limbs for circulation as soon as possible after application, and then at least every 15 minutes. During the time that a patient is in restraints, continuous attention to the patient's airway, circulation, and vital signs is mandatory. Apply ECG, SpO2 and ETCO2 monitors if available.
* The restrained patient must be under constant observation by a licensed EMS clinician at all times and may not be left unattended.
* Consider de-escalation of restraints if appropriate in the judgment of the EMS clinician.

3) Allow lidocaine to dwell in IO space for 60 seconds.
4) Flush IO with 5-10 ml normal saline.
5) Slowly administer an additional dose of lidocaine IO (20 mg) over 60 seconds. (Pediatric dose: 0.25 mg/kg, not to exceed 20 mg)
6) Consider systemic pain medication for patients not responding to IO lidocaine.Key procedural considerations: Only 1 (one) attempt is permitted per extremityIndications for use of Previously Established Central Line Access:
This procedure may be performed on any critically ill or injured patient who requires IV drugs
or IV fluids AND in whom a peripheral line cannot be established.Contraindications: Inability to freely aspirate blood out of the catheter.Key procedural considerations: Central line access (Implantable Ports, Port-A-Caths, Medports)
A. May only be used if the device has already been accessed and IV fluid set-up has been established and running.
B. These devices require special needles (non-coring type) for access. The device may be
damaged if standard jumper (conventional) needles are used to access the ports.
