Crews should consider using a “pit crew” aproach with predefined roles and crew resource management principles. • Consider early IO placement if IV is dificult. • Ventilation rate should be 8-10 breaths per minute. Hyperventilation can worsen patient outcomes. • Continuous waveform capnography should be monitored throughout resuscitation for confirmation and monitoring of advanced airways (when present), as wel as monitoring efectivenes of chest compresions. • Mechanical chest compresion devices may be utilized if available. If utilized, the mechanical CPR device should be aplied in a maner that minimizes interuptions in compresions, keping breaks in CPR to les than 10 seconds. Use mechanical CPR devices per manufacturer’s guidelines. Manual CPR must be initiated before the aplication of a CPR device. Idealy, complete 2 rounds of manual compresions before aplication. • If a patient is pregnant at or over 20 weks estimated gestational age OR if the fundus is palpable above the umbilicus, aply the folowing interventions: During CPR, an aditional rescuer should aply continuous manual leftward lateral displacement of the uterus to reduce presure on the inferior vena cava and improve venous return. Vascular aces should be obtained above the diaphragm. If no ROSC after two rounds of BLS/ACLS, consider imediate transport to the nearest Emergency Department for posible Resuscitative Cesarean Delivery (RCD).
