Hemorrhage Control LEVEL: EMT/AEMT/Paramedic *Note: Use of Tranexamic Acid is Paramedic only* Hemorrhage: This procedure may be performed on any patient that has bleeding from an extremity, junctional hemorrhage or torso hemorrhage. Extremity Hemorrhage – Tourniquet Application: A. Apply tourniquet proximal to the bleeding site. B. Absolute contraindication: Bleeding has stopped C. If bleeding is not controlled, consider additional tightening or applying a second tourniquet proximal side by side to the first. D. Wound packing does not preclude you from placing a tourniquet. Junctional Hemorrhage – Wound Packing: A. Junctional Hemorrhage Defined: hemorrhage occurring at the junction of an extremity with the torso, and/or the base of the neck. B. Use direct pressure and an appropriate pressure dressing with deep wound packing (plain gauze or, if available, hemostatic gauze). C. Absolute Contraindication: Hemostatic gauze use on hemorrhaging abdominal wounds. Torso Hemorrhage – Consider Tranexamic Acid for blunt or penetrating chest or abdominal trauma with suspected blood loss. Paramedic Administration Only. 1. Dose: Adults: 1 g IV/IO over 10 min for patients with SBP<90 and HR>110 2. Tranexamic Acid is ideally given within the first hour of injury. 3.
