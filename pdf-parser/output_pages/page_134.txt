Cervical Stabilization LEVEL: EMT/AEMT/Paramedic Cervical stabilization is indicated in any patient who meets the indications (A-E) below: Indications: This procedure may be performed on any patient with potential for spinal injury based upon the following (NEXUS) criteria: A. Midline cervical spinal tenderness B. Focal neurologic deficit C. Altered mental status D. Evidence of drug and/or alcohol intoxication E. Any painful, distracting injury Contraindications: Cervical stabilization is NOT performed in the following conditions: A. Penetrating trauma to the head and/or neck and no evidence of spinal injury B. Injuries where placement of the collar might compromise patient assessment, airway management, ventilation and/or hemorrhage control C. Patients in cardiac arrest Key procedural considerations: A. If (A-E) above are ALL NEGATIVE, cervical stabilization is not required. B. If required, cervical stabilization is the placement of an approved, properly- sized cervical collar before the patient is moved. C. Tape, head straps, wedges, and head and/or neck support devices are not recommended. D. Patients found in motor vehicles should be asked if they are able to exit the motor vehicle on their own. If so, they should be assisted to a soft stretcher and secured for transport. Patients unable to exit the vehicle on their own accord should be removed by the appropriate extrication method. E. Once on the stretcher, the patient may be moved to a semi-Fowler’s or high-Fowler’s position for comfort. F. If a backboard is used for extrication or movement, the patient should be immediately moved to a soft mattress, if possible. G. In special situations, alternate stabilization devices (e.g. vacuum mattress, KED, etc. may be used as indicated). H. Pediatric patients may be stabilized in an approved car seat or with a commercial pediatric stabilization device. Cervical Stabilization 134
