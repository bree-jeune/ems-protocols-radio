History Signs and Symptoms Differential • Past medical history • HR <60/min with hypotension, • Acute myocardial infarction • Medications acute AMS, chest pain, acute • Hypoxia • Pacemaker CHF, seizures, syncope, or • Pacemaker failure shock secondary to bradycardia • Hypothermia • Respiratory distress • Sinus bradycardia • Athletic • Head injury (elevated ICP) or stroke • Spinal cord lesion • AV block • Overdose Pearls • Recommended Exam: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lung, Neuro. • Identifying signs and symptoms of poor perfusion caused by bradycardia are paramount. Treatment should only be given when patient is symptomatic due to bradycardia. Athletes, patients on beta blockers, and young healthy patients may have a slow resting heart rate at baseline. • Do not delay pacing while waiting for IV access. • Ensure adequate oxygenation and provide ventilatory support as needed. • Consider hyperkalemia in patients with wide complex bradycardia. • Atropine is unlikely to be effective and should be avoided in patients who have had a heart transplant. QI Metrics • High degree blocks correctly identified. • Pacer pads on patient if Atropine given. • Patient paced if appropriate. Bradycardia 24
