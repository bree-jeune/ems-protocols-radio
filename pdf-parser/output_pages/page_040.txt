Presentation of a single arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate transport to the hospital. Notify the intended receiving facility as early as possible to allow preparation of the receiving team. For complicated deliveries (breech, prolapsed cord, shoulder dystocia), initiate appropriate prehospital interventions per protocol. If unable to resolve the complication or if delivery does not progress after indicated maneuvers, maintain maternal and fetal support and expedite transport while continuing interventions en route. • Any pregnant patient involved in a motor vehicle collision or other significant trauma should be strongly encouraged to be seen by a physician for evaluation.
