History Signs and Symptoms Differential • Events leading to arrest • Unresponsive • Medical vs. Trauma • Estimated down time • Apneic • VF vs. Pulseless VT • Past medical history • Pulseless • Asystole • Medications • PEA • Existence of terminal illness • Primary cardiac event vs. respiratory or drug overdose Pearls • Respiratory failure resulting in cardiac arrest should be addressed as it is identified. • Efforts should be directed at high quality chest compressions with limited interruptions and early defibrillation when indicated. • Consider early IO placement if IV is difficult. • DO NOT HYPERVENTILATE. • Once an advanced airway is in place, compressions should be continuous with ventilations every three seconds. • Reassess and document ETT placement using auscultation and ETCO2 capnography. • Switch compressors every two minutes. • Try to maintain patient modesty. • Mechanical chest compression devices should be used if available and appropriate for patient age/size in order to provide for consistent uninterrupted chest compressions and crew safety. • Adult paddles/pads may be used on children weighing greater than 10 kg. • Pre-assignment of pit crew roles is recommended. When this is not possible, tasks may be assigned by order of arrival: 1st: Airway; 2nd: Compressions; 3rd: IV/IO access, medication administration; 4th: Measure, Monitor/AED placement; 5th: family liaison/history gathering • Pre-plan drug dosing based on weight estimations while en route and verify with a height based tape once reaching the patient • Proper BVM selection: <5 kg = infant BVM. 5-30 kg = pediatric BVM. >30 kg = adult BVM. H’s & T’s (reversible causes) • Hypovolemia – Volume infusion • Hypoxia – Oxygenation & ventilation, CPR • Hydrogen ion (acidosis) – Ventilation, CPR • Hyperkalemia – Calcium Chloride, Glucose, Sodium Bicarbonate, Albuterol • Hypokalemia • Hypothermia – Warming • Hypoglycemia – Glucose • Tension pneumothorax – Needle decompression • Tamponade, cardiac – Volume infusion • Toxins – Agent specific antidote • Thrombosis, pulmonary – Volume infusion • Thrombosis, coronary – Emergent PCI Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (Non-Traumatic)(revised and approved by MAB 4/3/2024) 89
