Needle Thoracostomy LEVEL: Paramedic Indications: This procedure may be performed on any patient who has evidence of a tension pneumothorax, demonstrated by the following criteria: 1. Severe/progressive respiratory distress and/or increased resistance to bagging, AND unilateral diminished/absent breath sounds, AND: A. Hypotension with signs of shock, or B. Persistent hypoxia despite supplemental oxygen, or C. Jugular venous distention, or D. Tracheal deviation (late sign) 2. Any traumatic cardiac arrest with chest or abdominal trauma and undergoing resuscitation should have bilateral needle thoracostomy performed as soon as possible. Contraindications: None Needle Decompression is permitted in pediatric patients. Key procedural considerations: A. Select and identify insertion site: 1. Primary site is the 4th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line of the affected side. a. Needle should be placed within the “triangle of safety” . Insertion site must be above the nipple line as the nipple lies flat against the chest wall with the arm abducted. b. In females, the breast can displace the nipple inferiorly. If displaced, the clinician should identify where the nipple would lie if flat against the chest wall. This will be superior to the inframammary fold/crease. When in doubt, a more superior site is preferred. 2. Alternate site is the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line of the affected side. C. Use appropriate size needle and length. D. Prep site with appropriate disinfectant (e.g. iodine, chlorhexidine, alcohol) E. Place tip of needle on top of appropriate rib and insert over top of rib into intercostal space. F. Advance needle into pleural space and remove needle. Leave catheter in place. G. Consider attaching a one-way valve, if available. Needle Thoracostomy (revised and approved by MAB 04/03/2024) 145
