Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) LEVEL: Paramedic/AEMT Indications: This process may be performed on any patient 18 years old or older in CHF, respiratory distress with bronchospasm, and pneumonia, who has TWO of the following: A. Retractions or accessory muscle use B. Respiratory rate >25 per minute C. SpO2 < 94% Contraindications: A. Apnea B. Vomiting or active GI bleed C. Major trauma/pneumothorax D. Altered mental status Use device per manufacturer instructions Key procedural considerations: A. Assess patient and document VS, SpO2 and ETCO2 if available prior to applying oxygen. Paramedics must document ETCO2. B. Select the appropriate size face mask for the patient. C. Inform the patient about procedure process. D. If using CPAP, gradually increase the flow rate, slowly reaching the desired CPAP pressure. Secure face mask onto patient’s face using the head harness. E. If using bilevel ventilation, select bilevel on the device, and set appropriate EPAP level and other device settings as appropriate. F. Check the mask and tubing for leaks. G. Reassess patient and document every five minutes. H. If the patient develops any of the contraindications or requires definitive airway control, discontinue NIPPV and provide necessary airway control.
