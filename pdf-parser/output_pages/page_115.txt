Pearls • Consider preoxygenation/lung denitrogenation with a non-rebreather or a nasal cannula at 15 LPM prior to intubation (as patient condition allows) • Severe hypotension (SBP 70+(2 X age)) should be addressed with IV fluids and/or pressors (as appropriate) prior to intubation in order to reduce likelihood of post-intubation cardiovascular decline. • Capnometry (Color) or capnography is mandatory with all methods of intubation. Document results. • Continuous capnography (ETCO2) is mandatory for the monitoring of all patients with an ET tube. • If an effective airway is being maintained by BVM and/or basic airway adjuncts (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway) with continuous pulse oximetry values of ≥90%, or values expected based on pathophysiologic condition with otherwise reassuring vital signs (e.g. pulse oximetry of 85% with otherwise normal vitals in a post drowning patient), it is acceptable to continue with basic airway measures instead of using an extraglottic airway device or intubation. • For the purposes of this protocol, a secure airway is achieved when the patient is receiving appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. • An Intubation Attempt is defined as passing the laryngoscope blade or endotracheal tube past the teeth or inserted into the nasal passage. • An appropriate ventilatory rate is one that maintains an ETCO2of 35 - 45. Avoid hyperventilation. • Paramedics should use an extraglottic airway device if oral-tracheal intubation is unsuccessful. • Maintain C-spine stabilization for patients with suspected spinal injury. • Gastric tube placement should be considered in all intubated patients if time allows. • It is important to secure the endotracheal tube well.
