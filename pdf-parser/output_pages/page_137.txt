Electrical Therapy/Transcutaneous Pacing LEVEL: Paramedic Indications: This procedure may be performed on any patient experiencing: A. Hemodynamically unstable bradycardia B. Unstable clinical condition that is likely because of bradycardia C. For pacing readiness (i.e. standby mode) in the setting of MI with bradycardia, second degree type II AV block, third degree AV block, new left or right alternating BBB or bifascicular block Contraindications: None Adjunctive therapy: In the conscious patient with a systolic blood pressure of >90 mm Hg consider: Sedation: Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IN/IM/IV/IO, max dose 5 mg. May repeat X 1 after 5 min at 0.05 mg/kg, max dose 2.5 mg. Further doses with Physician Order or; Diazepam 5 mg IV/IO. May repeat after five minutes with physician order. Analgesia: Morphine Sulfate up to 0.1 mg/kg slow IV/IO to a maximum single dose of 10 mg. May repeat after 10 minutes or; Fentanyl up to 1 mcg/kg IN/IM/IV/IO to a maximum single dose of 100 mcg. May repeat dose after 10 minutes with physician order or; Hydromorphone up to 1 mg IV/IO. May repeat dose after ten minutes with physician order or; Ketamine 0.2 mg/kg IM/IV/IN/IO no repeat dose. Key procedural considerations: A. Apply pacing pads, begin pacing at a rate of 60 beats per minute at the lowest available current. B. Increase current by 20 milliamp increments until electrical capture. C. In the event of electrical capture and no pulses, continue pacing and CPR.
