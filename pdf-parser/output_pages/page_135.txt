Electrical Therapy/Defibrillation LEVEL: Paramedic Indications: This procedure may be performed on any patient experiencing: A. Ventricular fibrillation B. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia C. Torsades de Pointes Contraindications: None Use device per manufacturer instructions Key Procedural Considerations: A. The initial and subsequent attempts shall be at the energy level(s) suggested by the device manufacturer and/or the agency’s medical director. B. Defibrillation should be immediately provided in an arrest WITNESSED by EMS personnel. In an arrest that is UNWITNESSED by EMS personnel, two minutes of CPR should be provided prior to defibrillation. C. Patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (AICD) will need external defibrillation if the AICD is ineffective. D. If defibrillation is needed on a patient with permanent implanted pacemaker, the defibrillator paddles or self-adhesive electrodes should be placed at least one inch from the pulse generator of the pacemaker, Initial attempt at pediatric defibrillation shall be at 2 J/kg. If unsuccessful, defibrillation should be attempted at 4 J/kg. Repeated defibrillations should be at > 4 J/kg to 10 J/kg until conversion occurs. Adult paddles/pads may be used in children weighing more than 10 kg. Electrical Therapy/Defibrillation (revised and approved by MAB 04/06/2022) 135
